            <h1 style="width: 85%; color: #F34B41; margin-top: 20px; text-align: left; font-family: roboto;">Coronavirus has many amazing benefits.</h1>
            <p style="margin: 0px; width: 85%; font-family: open sans; text-align: left; text-indent: 20px; font-size: 13px;">The recent outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) has caused confusion, pain, and distress to appear in the lives of many families battling the outbreak and to those whose lives have been put on hold. This outbreak has caused corporations to enter a state of bankruptcy and cost the lives of many. When we encounter an event such as this, people tend to think of the unfortunate side of situations; it’s just common human instinct. However, there have been many amazing progressions towards a positive direction with this outbreak such as a decrease in air pollution due to quarantine and the advancement of COVID-19 cures in Australia.</p>
            <p style="margin: 0px; width: 85%; font-family: open sans; text-align: left; text-indent: 20px; font-size: 13px;">Due to mass amounts of quarantine, pollution levels in major countries have dropped drastically because of the absence of vehicles and industry exhaust. The article states, “Some reports estimate that China’s quarantine has saved more than 100 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions from entering the atmosphere—which is about the equivalent of what Chile produces in a year.” This drop in Carbon Dioxide (CO2) is helping the environment substantially by increasing the quantity of Oxygen to combat the negative impact that humans have previously created. Along with this, “the canals and waterways of Venice are reportedly cleaner than ever” which also affects the state of our ecosystem. These effects could help us eliminate the destructive effects of our previous lives and even learn ways to better maintain these carbon-generators better. Occurring in “the land down under” (Australia), several science institutions have been working on a supposed “cure” for this destructive disease. The text suggests, “scientists have found that two different medications—both of which are registered and available in Australia—have completely wiped out traces of the disease in test tubes.” These tests could be an enormous step in the right direction of controlling this deadly virus. The text also suggests that some of the first Australian COVID-19 patients have experienced a “disappearance of the virus and complete recovery from the infection.” The efforts of these scientists may be the contributing factor to this diseases’ complete and total resolution.</p>
            <p style="margin: 0px; width: 85%; font-family: open sans; text-align: left; text-indent: 20px; font-size: 13px;">Instead of thinking the worst, there are so many incredible advancements towards this outbreak such as the elimination of Carbon Dioxide and a possible cure. There is always a good side to every situation, and these events are shaping society today for the better. The incredible impacts and efforts that these brave scientists and quarantine have caused have been a monumental blessing. These examples of light will help us endure through these hard times and present a more positive society.</p>
